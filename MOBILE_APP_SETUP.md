# üì± Scholara Mobile App Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through converting your Scholara website into a native iOS app for the App Store.

## üéØ Overview

We're using **Capacitor** to wrap your existing website into a native iOS app. This means:
- ‚úÖ No need to rewrite your entire app
- ‚úÖ Update the website = update the app
- ‚úÖ Can publish to App Store (iOS) AND Google Play (Android)
- ‚úÖ Access native features (camera, push notifications, etc.)

---

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Software
1. **Mac Computer** (required for iOS development)
2. **Xcode** (latest version from Mac App Store)
3. **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
4. **npm** (comes with Node.js)
5. **CocoaPods** (install with: `sudo gem install cocoapods`)

### Required Accounts
1. **Apple Developer Account** ($99/year)
   - Sign up at: https://developer.apple.com
2. **App Store Connect Account** (included with Apple Developer)

---

## üöÄ Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /path/to/scholarastudy
npm install
```

This installs Capacitor and all required dependencies.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Step 2: Initialize Capacitor iOS Project

```bash
# Initialize Capacitor (if not already done)
npx cap init

# Add iOS platform
npx cap add ios

# Copy web files to native project
npx cap copy ios

# Sync changes
npx cap sync ios
```

This creates the `ios/` folder with your Xcode project.

---

## üì± Step 3: Open in Xcode

```bash
npx cap open ios
```

This opens your project in Xcode.

### In Xcode:

1. **Select your Team**
   - Click on the project name (Scholara) in the left sidebar
   - Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab
   - Select your Apple Developer team from dropdown

2. **Update Bundle Identifier**
   - Change from `com.scholara.study` to your unique ID
   - Example: `com.yourname.scholara`

3. **Set Deployment Target**
   - Minimum iOS version: **iOS 13.0** or higher
   - This determines which iOS versions can install your app

4. **Configure App Icons** (see Step 5)

---

## üé® Step 4: Update App Metadata

### In `capacitor.config.json`:
- `appId`: Your unique bundle identifier (e.g., `com.scholara.study`)

### In Xcode:
1. Click on project name ‚Üí General tab
2. **Display Name**: "Scholara"
